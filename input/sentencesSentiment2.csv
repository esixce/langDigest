first i asked you if the sun was spinning around a giant black hole and you said no but the answer is yes."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"the center of the mily way is a black hole, the sun spins within the milkyway around the center, ergo the sun spins around a giant black hole."

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"You are correct that the center of the Milky Way contains a supermassive black hole, and the Sun is orbiting around the center of the Milky Way, which includes orbiting around the black hole."

0.0,0.737,0.263,0.3612,Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
0.161,0.839,0.0,-0.3612,I still believe you are mistaken because you are not able to meassure minute changes.
0.104,0.896,0.0,-0.296,the milky way could be collapsing so slowly that it would take hundreds of millions of years to meassure it.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Which we havent.
0.094,0.815,0.091,-0.0232,So you cannot state without reasonable doubt that the milky way could also be expanding or collapsing around the black hole.

0.0,0.905,0.095,0.296,"ok how is the universe expanding

The universe is expanding in the sense that the distances between galaxies are increasing over time."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"This expansion was first discovered by the astronomer Edwin Hubble in the 1920s, who observed that galaxies were moving away from us at speeds proportional to their distance."

0.0,0.94,0.06,0.3353,"The most widely accepted explanation for this expansion is the Big Bang theory, which posits that the universe began as a very hot and dense state around 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding and cooling ever since."
0.129,0.759,0.112,-0.34,"As the universe expands, the matter within it becomes more spread out, and the gravitational forces between galaxies become weaker."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"This causes the expansion to accelerate over time, rather than slowing down as might be expected."
